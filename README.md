# EMA Timber
 ## Overview
 This is a repository for the Eco-Metabolistic Architecture (EMA) project's Timber Track development at CITA, Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen, Denmark.
 The main topics of interest are the computational modelling of timber elements and structures, and how architectural design workflows can be interfaced with detailed computational mechanics models of timber behaviour.
